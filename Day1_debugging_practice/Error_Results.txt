The above error states the line 1 code is having Non-ASCII character
To fix, we are adding the quote to make all the characters in print function as valid characters:

Fix 1:

# Fixing the quotes for below line

print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
